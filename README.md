# Text Classification using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on **text classification** using traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.  
The pipeline includes **text preprocessing with NLTK**, **feature extraction using TF-IDF**, and **classification using Logistic Regression**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end NLP workflow, from raw text preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
